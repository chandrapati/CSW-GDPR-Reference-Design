# Cisco Secure Workload — GDPR Compliance Framework
## Reference Design | EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Use Case:** Fresh Install, Hybrid Environment (On-Prem + Cloud)  
**Legal anchor:** Regulation (EU) 2016/679 — this document addresses **technical security evidence** only; **legal interpretation, DPO decisions, legitimate-basis analysis, consent records, and DPIA sign-off** remain with qualified legal counsel and the controller.

---

> **Coverage legend** — this reference design and its compliance report use three words:
> - 🟢 **Direct** — CSW produces the primary evidence artifact.
> - 🟠 **Supporting** — CSW produces an input that feeds or complements another control.
> - ⚪ **Evidence Required** *(supplied outside CSW)* — CSW produces nothing here; the item is in scope for compliance but out of scope for CSW, so the customer evidences it via another control, tool, or process. A scope boundary, not a gap or "unsupported."

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Data controllers and processors operating in the
EU/EEA (or offering goods/services to persons in the Union), including
CISOs, privacy engineering teams, DPO *liaisons* (technical),
application owners handling personal data, and internal audit.

**Important limitation.** The GDPR is a **legal and organizational**
framework. Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) **does not**:

- determine **lawful basis** for processing;
- manage **consent** banners, cookies, or preference centers;
- fulfill **data subject rights** requests (access, erasure, portability)
by itself;
- replace **Records of Processing Activities (RoPA)** *narratives* —
though it can substantiate **data flows** described there with telemetry.

CSW **does** strengthen **Article 32** security of processing and
supplies **forensics** that support **Articles 33–34** technical
assessment, **Article 25** technical and organizational measures when
paired with governance, and **Article 30 / 35 / 28** evidence insofar
as your DPIA, RoPA, and processor oversight require **accurate,
verifiable** descriptions of how personal data moves and is protected
between systems.

**Questions this reference design helps you answer:**

- *Article 5(1)(f) — integrity and confidentiality: Can we show we
  implemented appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized
  processing, loss, or damage, including segmentation and visibility
  on systems that host or touch personal data?*
- *Article 25 — data protection by design and by default: Can we
  demonstrate network isolation of personal-data systems and
  least-privilege connectivity derived from observed need, not
  assumed trust?*
- *Article 30 — records of processing: Can we corroborate RoPa data
  flows (which systems exchange personal data, with whom, across which
  boundaries) using objective telemetry?*
- *Article 32 — security of processing: Can we evidence encryption
  posture in transit where relevant, segmentation enforcement,
  vulnerability visibility on workloads processing personal data, and
  monitoring?*
- *Articles 33–34 — breach notification: If a personal data breach
  occurs, can we reconstruct timeline, scope of affected systems, and
  exfiltration/lateral paths to inform supervisory authority and
  data-subject communication?*
- *Article 35 — DPIA: Can ADM and flow history support our analysis of
  necessity, proportionality, and residual risks for a new processing
  operation?*
- *Article 28 — processor / sub-processor oversight: Can we monitor
  and enforce egress paths from our environment to processors'
  endpoints and detect deviations?*

**What you'll need.** GDPR Article 30 inventory (even draft),
processing purposes per activity, data categories, **Article 28 /
DPAs** listing subprocessors, network diagrams, classification of
**systems that process personal data** (including pseudonymised
datasets), and legal guidance on **Schrems II / transfer tools** if US
cloud regions are in scope.

**Where to start.** Sections 1–2 for scope; 3–5 to deploy sensors and
build personal-data scopes; 6–7 for segregation by design; 8 for
control mapping; 9–10 for breach readiness and exports; **Boundaries**
before claiming GDPR *compliance* from CSW alone.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

**Read next:** [Compliance evidence playbook](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/docs/compliance-evidence-playbook.md) (full step-by-step) · [About CSW](https://github.com/chandrapati/CSW-Compliance-Mapping/blob/main/docs/about-csw.md) (platform intro)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- Art. 32 security-of-processing from enforcement + logging
- Art. 30 RoPA support via data-flow mapping
- Art. 33/34 breach timeline from flow search exports

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

---

## 1. Overview

The GDPR unifies data protection rules across the EU/EEA and governs
the processing of **personal data** and **special categories** where
applicable. Controllers must implement **appropriate technical and
organizational measures (TOMs)** under **Article 32**, ensure
**integrity and confidentiality** under **Article 5(1)(f)**, and
embed **data protection by design and by default** under **Article 25**.

CSW contributes to the **technical layer** of those obligations by
providing workload inventory, **microsegmentation**, detection of
**cleartext or risky protocols**, **application dependency mapping
(ADM)**, vulnerability context, **continuous monitoring**, and
**forensic flow/process data** for **breach assessment** and **DPIA**
inputs — always **in conjunction** with encryption products, IAM, DLP,
identity governance, contracts, and privacy programme operations.

### GDPR articles → CSW capabilities (high level)

| GDPR article / theme | Typical compliance questions | Relevant CSW capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| **Art. 5(1)(f)** — Integrity & confidentiality | Are personal data systems protected against unauthorized use, loss, or damage? | Segmentation; flow visibility; cleartext / risky-flow detection; alerts |
| **Art. 25** — Data protection by design & by default | Are we minimizing exposure by default (network & access paths)? | Scopes isolating personal-data tiers; default deny; ADM-driven least privilege |
| **Art. 30** — Records of processing activities | Are documented flows accurate vs reality? | ADM clusters; flow exports cross-checking RoPA |
| **Art. 32** — Security of processing | Confidentiality, integrity, availability, resilience — evidenced how? | Enforcement policies; patch/vuln reports; monitoring; resilience |
| **Art. 33–34** — Breach notification & communication | What happened, when, which systems, extent? | Time-bounded flow + process forensics; scope membership proofs |
| **Art. 35** — DPIA (where required) | What are processing risks & mitigations? | ADM + flow history; policy baseline; before/after for new processing |
| **Art. 28** — Processor & sub-processor terms | Is processing only occurring to documented endpoints? | Egress monitoring; alerts on new external destinations |

---

## 2. Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying CSW where personal data is processed:

- [ ] **Lawful basis & DPIA status** documented per processing activity
  (legal owner: DPO / counsel)
- [ ] CSW cluster residency reviewed against **data transfer**
  decisions (EU-only vs approved SCCs / IDTA, etc.)
- [ ] **DPA** in place with Cisco where CSW processes personal data on
  behalf of controller (typical SaaS scenario — verify with procurement/legal)
- [ ] **Inventory** of controllers' systems processing personal data —
  minimum: HRIS, CRM, marketing automation, auth directories, analytics
  warehouses, backups
- [ ] Cloud connectors configured for **AWS/Azure/GCP** workloads
  hosting personal data
- [ ] Stakeholders: **CISO**, **DPO/liaison**, **data owners**,
  **processor account managers**
- [ ] **Data minimization** principles applied to telemetry — confirm
  whether flow metadata alone suffices for your DPIA (avoid collecting
  unnecessary payload content in ancillary tools)

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Sensor Deployment (Days 1–5)

### 3.1 Personal-data processing tiers

Deploy sensors on **every workload** that stores, transforms, or
transmits personal data for in-scope activities: application servers,
databases, ETL workers, identity services, backup agents on app hosts,
microservices in Kubernetes worker nodes (per supported patterns), etc.

```bash
# Linux
sudo rpm -ivh tet-sensor-<version>.rpm    # RHEL family
sudo dpkg -i tet-sensor-<version>.deb    # Debian/Ubuntu

sudo systemctl enable --now csw-agent
sudo systemctl status csw-agent
```

```powershell
# Windows Server / worker roles processing personal data
msiexec /i "\\repo\tet-sensor-<version>.msi" /qn
Get-Service *tet*,*csw* -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**Initial settings:**

- **Monitoring Only** until ADM + DPIA-aligned review complete
- Tag early: `gdpr:in-scope`, `ropa-id:<activity>`, `data-class:personal`

### 3.2 Cloud personal-data estates

```
CSW UI → Platform → External Orchestrators
  → Connect cloud accounts processing EU data subjects
  → Map tags (cost center, env, `contains-pii`) into scopes
  → Enable flow visibility where supported
```

### 3.3 Validation

```
CSW UI → Manage → Agents
  → 100% coverage target for in-scope personal-data scopes
  → Escalate uncovered VMs/containers via change process
```

---

## 4. Phase 2 — Scope & Inventory Design (Days 6–12)

### 4.1 Scope hierarchy aligned to processing activities

Tie scopes to **RoPA activity IDs** — not only to network zones.

```
Root: GDPR-In-Scope
├── ROPA-HR-001 / HR-IS                       # Employee personal data
├── ROPA-CRM-004 / Customer-360               # Customer personal data
├── ROPA-MKT-006 / Campaign-Automation        # Marketing contacts (if applicable)
├── ROPA-Analytics-009 / Product-Analytics    # Pseudonymisation level documented legally
├── Shared-Services (conditional)
│   ├── IdP-AD          # personal data attributes? validate legally
│   └── Central-Logging
└── Sub-Processors-Egress
    ├── Payroll-SaaS endpoints (allowlisted FQDNs)
    └── Support-ticketing SaaS
```

### 4.2 Discovery filters (examples — tune to your estate)

```
Filter: Personal-Data-DB-Tier
  - Process: mysqld, postgres, mariadbd, sqlservr, mongod
  - Tag from CMDB: confidentiality=internal+personenbezogen

Filter: MarTech (if in scope)
  - Process contains: hubspot, marketo, salesforce-sync
  - Egress domains from RoPA appendix
```

### 4.3 Label taxonomy

| Label | Values | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ropa-id` | `HR-001`, `CRM-004` | Maps evidence to Article 30 record |
| `data-class` | `personal`, `special-category`, `pseudonymised` | Legal classification drives technical rigor |
| `processor` | `payroll-vendor-x` | Article 28 monitoring |
| `env` | `prod`, `staging` | Separate policy workspaces |
| `lawful-basis-ref` | internal ticket (not legal advice) | Cross-team traceability only |

---

## 5. Phase 3 — ADM & Baseline for Personal Data Flows (Days 13–28)

### 5.1 ADM workspace

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Application Dependency Mapping
  → Workspace: GDPR-Personal-Data-ADM
  → Scope: GDPR-In-Scope (prod)
  → Window: 3–6 weeks (payroll cycle + monthly batch jobs)
  → Process + user context where available
```

### 5.2 ADM ↔ RoPA reconciliation workflow

| Step | Owner | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Export ADM clusters | Security | Cluster list with IPs, processes, ports |
| 2. Map clusters to **processing purposes** | Data owner + DPO liaison | Updated RoPA appendix |
| 3. Flag **undocumented flows** to subprocessors | Privacy | Ticket + risk note for DPIA refresh |
| 4. Tag workloads post-validation | IT Ops | Labels `ropa-id` corrected |
| 5. Re-run ADM after major app changes | Security | Version-controlled export |

### 5.3 Article 25 — by-design segmentation inputs

From ADM, construct **least-privilege** intended connectivity **before**
wide enforcement:

- **Default deny** between unrelated RoPA activities sharing a VLAN
- **Dedicated** scopes for special-category data if legal requires
  separation
- **Dedicated** breach-isolation scope for **break-glass** admin

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Policy Design, Plaintext Detection & Enforcement (Days 22–40)

### 6.1 Segmentation policies (illustrative)

> Replace with your DPIA-approved architecture. **Simulation first.**

```
DENY: ROPA-MKT-006 → ROPA-HR-001   # marketing / HR separation example
DENY: Any → GDPR-In-Scope (default deny inbound except documented edges)

ALLOW: Customer-360 → IdP-AD (LDAPS 636 / Kerberos — block cleartext LDAP)
ALLOW: HR-IS → Payroll-SaaS-allowlist (443 to enumerated SaaS prefixes only)
LOG + ALERT: Personal-Data-DB-Tier → Internet except documented patch/CDN list
```

**Plaintext / weak-protocol mitigation (Art. 32 technical measure):**

- Create **detect-first** rules for `HTTP`, `FTP`, `LDAP:389` from
  scopes labeled `gdpr:in-scope`
- Escalate to **block** after joint sign-off with app owners

### 6.2 Policy workspace lifecycle

```
CSW UI → Defend → Segmentation
  → Workspace: GDPR-Personal-Data-Prod
  → Import ADM rules → legal/DPO review for business flows
  → Simulation 2–4+ weeks → phased enforcement
```

### 6.3 Enforcement stages

| Stage | Objective |
|---|---|
| Simulation | Measure would-block events; DPIA residual risk update if material |
| Tier-1 blocks | Stop cleartext admin & obvious internet exposure from DB tier |
| Full enforcement | Default deny between RoPA scopes except allowlisted conduits |

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Monitoring, Vulnerability & Resilience (ongoing)

### 7.1 Monitoring alerts (examples)

| Alert | Trigger | GDPR linkage |
|---|---|---|
| New subprocessor destination | Flow to IP/FQDN not in RoPA allowlist | Art. 28, Art. 30 accuracy |
| Cleartext personal-data path | HTTP/LDAP from in-scope DB/app tier | Art. 32, Art. 5(1)(f) |
| Lateral movement | New east-west path between personal-data scopes | Art. 32, breach assessment |
| Vulnerability regression | Critical CVE on personal-data workload | Art. 32, risk-based security |
| Anomalous volume | Possible exfil pattern | Art. 33 technical scoping |

### 7.2 Vulnerability management tie-in

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Vulnerability Report
  → Scope: GDPR-In-Scope
  → Export → attach to Art. 32 TOM evidence pack / ISMS control testing
```

---

## 8. Control-by-control mapping — requirement → CSW capability → evidence

| GDPR requirement (summary) | CSW capability | Evidence produced |
|---|---|---|
| **Art. 5(1)(f)** — integrity & confidentiality; safeguards against unauthorized processing, loss, destruction, damage | Microsegmentation; monitoring; cleartext/plaintext-path detection; vuln visibility | Policy exports; alert history; flow reports; VA exports |
| **Art. 25(1–2)** — data protection by design & by default (appropriate technical measures) | Scopes isolating processing activities; default deny; ADM-driven least privilege | ADM reports; before/after policy versions; architecture memos |
| **Art. 30** — records of processing (accuracy of systems & transfers) | ADM & flow telemetry validating documented flows | RoPA crosswalk spreadsheet + CSW exports |
| **Art. 32(1)** — pseudonymisation & encryption **(implementation uses complementary tools)**; ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, resilience | Path hygiene (TLS-only); segmentation fault isolation; resilience via anomaly detection | TLS vs plain detection logs; HA architecture tie-in narrative |
| **Art. 32(1)(d)** — process for regularly testing effectiveness | Scheduled policy drills; simulation reruns after changes | Test reports; change tickets |
| **Art. 33–34** — personal data breach notice / communication | Flow + process forensics; scope membership proof | Incident timeline bundle; affected-system list skeleton (*legal finalizes*) |
| **Art. 35** — DPIA where required | ADM + capacity/flow data for necessity & proportionality; residual risk after segmentation | DPIA annex packs (technical appendix) |
| **Art. 28** — processor instructions & safeguards; sub-processors | Egress allowlists; alerts on new destinations; enforcement audit | Processor monitoring dashboards; monthly export to account owner |

---

## 9. Breach notification readiness (Articles 33–34)

### 9.1 Technical drill checklist

- [ ] Confirm **UTC time sync** on agents & CSW cluster
- [ ] Run **quarterly** test export: `Flow Search` restricted to random
  1-hour window — validate tooling & analyst skills
- [ ] Maintain **contact tree**: DPO, legal, supervisory authority
  escalation (*pre-filled by legal*)
- [ ] Map CSW **scope IDs** to **processing activity IDs** for rapid
  impact narrative

### 9.2 Evidence bundle contents (non-exhaustive)

```
CSW UI → Investigate → Flow Search
  → Incident start/end
  → Affected workload filter (scope or IP list)
  → Export: flows with process, user (if present), bytes, duration

CSW UI → Investigate → Process Search
  → Suspicious parent/child processes on compromised host
```

Pair with **IAM logs**, **EDR**, **WAF**, and **application audit**
tables — CSW is **one lens** on network/workload truth.

```bash
# After UI export — package for legal hold (illustrative)
mkdir -p ~/gdpr-breach-pack/incident-2026-001/{flows,process,policies}
cp ~/Downloads/flows-*.csv ~/gdpr-breach-pack/incident-2026-001/flows/
shasum -a 256 ~/gdpr-breach-pack/incident-2026-001/flows/* \
  > ~/gdpr-breach-pack/incident-2026-001/manifest-sha256.txt
```

---

## 10. Audit preparation & evidence export

### 10.1 Quarterly / annual privacy & security evidence

| Evidence item | CSW source | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| Segmentation policy baseline | Defend export | Art. 25, 32 — TOM substantiation |
| RoPA crosswalk | ADM + spreadsheet | Art. 30 accuracy |
| Sim-to-enforcement audit trail | Policy workspace history | Change control |
| Vulnerability report | Vulnerabilities | Art. 32 testing / risk mgmt |
| Alert summary | Alerts | Art. 32 monitoring effectiveness |
| Processor egress review | Flow reports filtered by allowlist | Art. 28 oversight |

### 10.2 DPAs & subprocessors

Maintain a **CSW rule object** or **external documentation** listing
approved SaaS **FQDNs / IP ranges**. When ADM discovers **new**
destinations, route through **vendor risk + legal** before allowlisting.

---

## 11. Boundaries — what CSW does **not** cover

- **Lawfulness of processing / consent / legitimate interest balancing**
  — legal analysis only.
- **Data subject rights fulfillment** — access, rectification, erasure,
  portability workflows in business applications and backup rotation.
- **Privacy notices & transparency** — website / UX content.
- **International transfer mechanisms** alone — CSW may show *where
  data flows*; **Schrems II** TIA completion is separate.
- **Organizational measures**: training, HR sanctions, confidentiality
  agreements, **pure policy** documents without technical control.
- **Completeness of RoPA text fields** — purpose, retention schedules,
  legal basis — CSW cannot author those; it can **validate flows**.
- **Encryption at rest** — typically database/storage layer; CSW does
  not replace database TDE / storage CMK governance.

---

## 12. Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Assuming **encryption** because HTTPS default port | Validate **SNI**, termination points, & east-west plaintext |
| Scoping CSW only to **EU region** subnets while **US teams** administer | Include admin paths; document transfers |
| Stale RoPA after cloud refactor | Re-run ADM on every major architecture change |
| Over-collecting evidence with personal data inside **SIEM** | Prefer **metadata** flows; align with minimization |
| Treating CSW export as **DPIA sign-off** | DPIA remains accountable to **controller + DPO** |
